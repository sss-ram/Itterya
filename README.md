This project focuses on developing technology-driven solutions for undertrial prisoners in India. It aims to address challenges such as limited legal aid, access to justice, and rehabilitation through the creation of a mobile app, a platform linking prisoners with legal resources, and a rehabilitation program. The project's deliverables include a functional prototype, a comprehensive business plan, and a persuasive pitch deck, with expected impacts including increased access to legal aid, improved rehabilitation outcomes, and enhanced transparency in the criminal justice system. This initiative seeks to fill critical gaps in the support and rehabilitation of undertrial prisoners. By leveraging technology, it endeavors to empower prisoners with legal assistance, connect them with pro bono lawyers, and facilitate access to education and vocational training. Through these efforts, the project aims to promote fairness, reduce recidivism, and foster collaboration between legal and tech experts for meaningful social change.
Key components of the architecture include the Awareness Campaigns module, the Legal Resources Platform, and the Communication Platform. The Awareness Campaigns module connects with legal organizations to disseminate information about prisoners' rights and track the progress of these campaigns. The Legal Resources Platform serves as a repository for legal aid services, pro bono lawyers, and other legal assistance resources, bridging the gap between undertrial prisoners and the legal community. The Communication Platform ensures seamless interaction and coordination among prisoners, legal experts, and support organizations.
The system's multiple databases store critical information, such as awareness campaign data, prisoner details, legal organization data, and communication logs. Outputs generated by the system include progress reports on awareness campaigns, updates on legal aid assistance, and details about available legal resources. This integrated approach aims to enhance access to justice and rehabilitation for undertrial prisoners by providing comprehensive support and facilitating effective communication among all stakeholders.
