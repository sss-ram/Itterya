This project focuses on developing technology-driven solutions for undertrial prisoners in India. It aims to address challenges such as limited legal aid, access to justice, and rehabilitation through the creation of a mobile app, a platform linking prisoners with legal resources, and a rehabilitation program. The project's deliverables include a functional prototype, a comprehensive business plan, and a persuasive pitch deck, with expected impacts including increased access to legal aid, improved rehabilitation outcomes, and enhanced transparency in the criminal justice system. This initiative seeks to fill critical gaps in the support and rehabilitation of undertrial prisoners. By leveraging technology, it endeavors to empower prisoners with legal assistance, connect them with pro bono lawyers, and facilitate access to education and vocational training. Through these efforts, the project aims to promote fairness, reduce recidivism, and foster collaboration between legal and tech experts for meaningful social change
